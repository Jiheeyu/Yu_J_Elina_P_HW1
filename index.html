			<h1>Jiheui Yu!</h1>
			<p>Hi I'm Ji heui Yu! <br/>
			Friends just call Jihee. <br/>
			I'm from Korea. My major was textile design in College.<br/>
			After I graduate, I came to Canada to study English in 2017.
			I finished ESL program in Fanshawe in 2018 July. <br/>
			I went back to Korea. Then I had been learning about UI design for a few month while I was staying in Korea.<br/>
			I'd love to hang out with some friends and travel around the world.
			I hope to learn many things from this course.
